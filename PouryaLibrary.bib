abstract = {They proposed a GPU-accelerated Marching Tetrahedra that stores the topology of the surface in GPU. They used an span-space interval tree to cull tetrahedron elements that donot intersect with the surface. Caching edge-surface intersections helped them to avoid redundant calculations.},
annote = {In this paper the authors proposed an Edge-based processing algorithm that avoids redudant computations and is guaranteed to find all surface intersections.
        
In its canonical layout each tetrahedra is labeled at its vertices and edges. Only 3 cases are outputing polygons and in order to find them edge 3 is checked :
        
1. case2: If vertices v1 and v2 at edge 3 have differently signed field values. This will output a quad crossing edges e1,e2,e3,e4.
        
2. case1: if v1 and v2 at edge 3 both have field values greater than iso. (HOT) (e0, e1, e2 output quad)
        
3. case3: if v1 and v2 at edge 3 both have field values less than iso. (COLD) (e2, e4, e5 output triangle)
        
So the decision is only based on edge 3. 
        
To find the surface they used linear interpolation. In classic MT for each potentially created intersection point 4 fieldvalues are computed and if multiple tetrahedra share an edge the process have to be repeated for all adjacent elements. This means repeated field value evaluations.
        
Data Structures:
        
1. Grid Vertices: A floating point texture which store coordinates of the grid point and field value at that point in this format: X, Y, Z, S
        
2. Grid Edges: A edge texture is used in which each texel carries an index pair referencing the two vertices connected by that edge. So every edge can access its endpoints and the scalar field values at those end points. So the intersection point along that edge can be computed. 
        
3. Interpolated Intersection points: A vertex array holds interpolated intersection points with another field which labels the coordinates to be valid or not. Format: X, Y, Z, M
M is -1 if the intersection point doesnot exist and v1, v2 are both greater than the iso-value (Both are hot)
        
M is -2 if the intersection point doesnot exist and v1, v2 are both less than the iso-value (Both are cold)
M is the interpolation parameter which implies the intersection corrdinates are valid and M is between [0,1]
        
Extra Considerations:
Each edge is processed only one. Each edge is oriented such that first vertex has smaller field value compared to second one.
        
        
4. For polygon outputs. A quad is always output for each tetrahedron. 
        
Most of the performance gain is because of processing each edge-surface intersection interpolation only once.

@article{Singh2010,
abstract = {Compact representation of geometry using a suitable procedural or mathematical model and a ray-tracing mode of rendering fit the programmable graphics processor units (GPUs) well. Several such representations including parametric and subdivision surfaces have been explored in recent research. The important and widely applicable category of the general implicit surface has received less attention. In this paper, we present a ray-tracing procedure to render general implicit surfaces efficiently on the GPU. Though only the fourth or lower order surfaces can be rendered using analytical roots, our adaptive marching points algorithm can ray trace arbitrary implicit surfaces without multiple roots, by sampling the ray at selected points till a root is found. Adapting the sampling step size based on a proximity measure and a horizon measure delivers high speed. The sign test can handle any surface without multiple roots. The Taylor test that uses ideas from interval analysis can ray trace many surfaces with complex roots. Overall, a simple algorithm that fits the SIMD architecture of the GPU results in high performance. We demonstrate the ray tracing of algebraic surfaces up to order 50 and nonalgebraic surfaces including a Blinn's blobby with 75 spheres at better than interactive frame rates.},

It allows for the relatively easy introduction of patient-specific anatomy and supports many common file formats. It performs soft-tissue modeling, some limited rigid-body dynamics, and suture modeling. The simulator interfaces to many different interaction devices and provides for multi-user, multi-instrument collaboration over the Internet. Many virtual tools have been created and their interactions with tissue have been implemented. In addition, a number of extra features, such as voice input/output, real-time texture-mapped video input, stereo and head-mounted display support, and replicated display facilities are presented.},

@article{Miller2002,
abstract = {This paper contains experimental results of in vitro, uniaxial tension of swine brain tissue in finite deformation as well as proposes a new hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model for the brain tissue. The experimental results obtained for two loading velocities, corresponding to strain rates of 0.64 and 0.64 x 10(-2)s(-1), are presented. We believe that these are the first ever experiments of this kind. The applied strain rates were similar to those applied in our previous study, focused on explaining brain tissue properties in compression. The stress-strain curves are convex downward for all extension rates. The tissue response stiffened as the loading speed increased, indicating a strong stress-strain rate dependence. Swine brain tissue was found to be considerably softer in extension than in compression. Previously proposed in the literature brain tissue constitutive models, developed based on experimental data collected in compression are shown to be inadequate to explain tissue behaviour in tension. A new, non-linear, viscoelastic model based on the generalisation of the Ogden strain energy hyper-elastic constitutive equation is proposed. The new model accounts well for brain tissue deformation behaviour in both tension and compression (natural strain in <-0.3,0.2>) for strain rates ranging over five orders of magnitude.},

@article{Hua2004,
abstract = {This paper systematically presents a novel, interactive solid modeling framework, Haptics-based Dynamic Implicit Solid Modeling, which is founded upon volumetric implicit functions and powerful physics-based modeling. In particular, we augment our modeling framework with a haptic mechanism in order to take advantage of additional realism associated with a 3D haptic interface. Our dynamic implicit solids are semi-algebraic sets of volumetric implicit functions and are governed by the principles of dynamics, hence responding to sculpting forces in a natural and predictable manner. In order to directly manipulate existing volumetric data sets as well as point clouds, we develop a hierarchical fitting algorithm to reconstruct and represent discrete data sets using our continuous implicit functions, which permit users to further design and edit those existing 3D models in real-time using a large variety of haptic and geometric toolkits, and visualize their interactive deformation at arbitrary resolution. The additional geometric and physical constraints afford more sophisticated control of the dynamic implicit solids. The versatility of our dynamic implicit modeling enables the user to easily modify both the geometry and the topology of modeled objects, while the inherent physical properties can offer an intuitive haptic interface for direct manipulation with force feedback.},

abstract = {The use of biomechanical modelling, especially in conjunction with finite element analysis, has become common in many areas of medical image analysis and surgical simulation. Clinical employment of such techniques is hindered by conflicting requirements for high fidelity in the modelling approach, and fast solution speeds. We report the development of techniques for high-speed nonlinear finite element analysis for surgical simulation. We use a fully nonlinear total Lagrangian explicit finite element formulation which offers significant computational advantages for soft tissue simulation. However, the key contribution of the work is the presentation of a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) solution scheme for the finite element equations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first GPU implementation of a nonlinear finite element solver. We show that the present explicit finite element scheme is well suited to solution via highly parallel graphics hardware, and that even a midrange GPU allows significant solution speed gains (up to 16.8 x) compared with equivalent CPU implementations. For the models tested the scheme allows real-time solution of models with up to 16,000 tetrahedral elements. The use of GPUs for such purposes offers a cost-effective high-performance alternative to expensive multi-CPU machines, and may have important applications in medical image analysis and surgical simulation.},

1. Focuses in design, mechanics and interfaces required to build a haptic device.
2. The study of human sensation and manipulation through touch. We have 2 different touch information through neurons:
a. Tactile information b.Kinesthetic information 
        
3. Computer Haptics: Algorithms and software related to model virtual objects and rendring and generating the touch and feel of virtual objects.
        
The probe of device can be modelled as 1. A Point 2. As a Ray 3. As a 3D object
        
Haptic Rendering involves: Collision Detection and Collision Response
Sequences of collision detections and Responses are called a haptic loop.
        
The probe is freely moving in virtual environment with no forces stimulated to the user until it collides with some virtual object, tissue or organ the we need to compute the amount of penetration of tool inside organ and compute the feedback force vector. This force vector can be modified based on the surface propterties and texture of object at the point of collision. The force will be applied back to the user holding the controller.},

abstract = {Computation of soft tissue mechanical responses for surgery simulation and image-guided surgery has been dominated by the finite element (FE) method that utilises a mesh of interconnected elements as a computational grid. Shortcomings of such mesh-based discretisation in modelling of surgical cutting include high computational cost and the need for re-meshing in the vicinity of cutting-induced discontinuity. The meshless total Lagrangian adaptive dynamic relaxation (MTLADR) algorithm we present here does not exhibit such shortcomings, as it relies on spatial discretisation in a form of a cloud of nodes. The cutting-induced discontinuity is modelled solely through changes in nodal domains of influence, which is done through efficient implementation of the visibility criterion using the level set method. Accuracy of our MTLADR algorithm with visibility criterion is confirmed against the established nonlinear solution procedures available in the commercial FE code Abaqus.},

@article{Kim2002,
annote = {In this article the authors compare haptic rendering algorithms. There are 3 approaches that have been proposed :
        
1.Penalty -based approach which has limits: a. Strong force discontinuity b. Push-Through of thin objects.
        
2.Constraint-based approach: Force discontinuity
        
The previous approaches gradient of the potential value is used for calculating the force which is not proportional to the distance of a virtual contact point on the surface.
It is a good approximation only when the distance between HIP and surface is zero. This issue will cause the stiff surfaces feel soft.
        
They used closest point transform (CPT) algorithm to find the volumetric implicit surface of a geometric model. (Solving the Eikonal equation using the method of charactristics)
This way they created force continuity on the surface a model.
        
Direction of the force applied upon the implicit surface is given by computing the gradient at the probe position. Shooting a ray to the surface along this gradient will give a Virtual Surface Contact point or (GOD OBJECT).
Gradient direction is also the force direction. 
        
The final force that should be sent back to the user is : F = (P\_c - P\_t)*K - b*V where P\_c is the virtual contact point and P\_t is the HIP position and K is the spring contant.
b is the Damper coefficient and V is the device speed.
        
When the user moves the probe from P\_t to P\_t+dt the friction is modelled as a retarding force applied to the tangent between Vistual Sarface contact points:
        
        
F\_t = P\_c+dt - P\_c 
        
f\_r = f\_c * (1+ (||P\_c+dt - P\_t+dt||)*d)
        
F\_r = - F\_t * f\_r
P\_n = P\_c + (F\_t + F\_r)
        
P'\_n = Intersection ( Ray ( P\_n - P\_t+dt ) )
        
Then we compute the final force again.
        
Texture of surface is modelled by applying a gaussian noise on the field values at grid nodes or by applying a Lattice Pattern on the field values at nodes.},

The topology is a classic Master-Slave Architecture. Each node assigned a rank and two versions of Polygonization Algorithm provided. One for Masster duties and the other for slave duties.
        
Using Continuation method master will find all the cubes across the surface and save them in a list. Then using TCP/IP broadcast method available in MPI master node will send the entire list to all it's slave nodes.
        
Then Master will switch to slave and all the slaves will start triangulating the Voxels. After triangulation each slave node will return all the triangles to the Master node by using MPI::WORLD\_COMM::Allgatherv().
        
Master will put them in order and show.
        
Their method is not parallel in continuation part. And also communication between nodes is expensive. Finding cubes is the bottle neck of this architect.},

abstract = {This paper presents Original Marching Triangles which was proposed by Hilton and made some corrections for skeletal implicit surfaces.},
annote = {        This paper presents Marching Triangles proposed by Hilton and suggested some correction method for closing gaps and creating closed manifold meshes. 
Marching triangles has 2 major steps: Prediction and Correction and may fail to find a global surface overlap and therefore cannot generate closed surfaces.
          
Delaunay constraint: We have a set of points X on the manifold surface. Delaunay triangulation is composed of Triangles T and there is a sphere passing through each triangles that contains no other points from X. 
          
CONDITION TOBE CHECKED:
The triangles T(Xk, Xk+1, Xp) can be added to the surface mesh if the cirsumscribing sphere of T with the center point CT doesnot intersect any other triangles of the mesh with the same orientation.
          
1. if T(Xk, Xk+1, Xp) passes the condition above we add the triangle and save the edges E(Xp, Xk) and E(Xp, Xk+1).
          
2. if it doesnot pass we check whether X(Xk-1, Xk, Xk+1) and T(Xk, Xk+1, Xk+2) can pass the condition.
          
3. Otherwise we skip E(Xk, Xk+1) to the next edge.
          
4. Correction: we start from a seed triangles that can be found from the skeleton and we push the edges of that triangle into the list Le. For each edge we test if we can add a triangle to the mesh conforming to the delaunay condition. 
          
5. Termination condition: We continue the process until Le is empty or no more triangles may be added this way.
          
6. We close the gaps afterwards.
          
7. Creating Triangles: For each edge in Le we e(Xk, Xk+1) we find the mid-point Xm and project it to the surface along grad(F(Xm)) the new point is Xs. Then we compute a direction vector (Normalized Vector): t = (e \^{} grad(F(Xs))) / ||(e\^{} grad(F(Xs)))||
          
Then we move X=Xs + dt and d = (radical(3)/2) * [( Ek-1 + Ek + Ek+1) / 3]
          
Tobe able to create large triangles after shrinking triangles on High Frequency areas we use a constraint on Minimum distance: 
          
if D < Dmin then D = 3/4D + 1/4 Dmin and Dmin should be supplied by user
          
8. The final point of the triangle on the implicit surface Xp is computed as follows from X:
          
We start from X and march toward the surface to find another point on the other side of the surface which is Y then we use Bisection method to get the intersection point Xp.
          
 a. An approximate distance to the surface is given by: d = f(X)/||grad(F(X))||
 b. u = grad(F(x))/||grad(F(x))||
 c. y = x - alpha * d * u;
          
9. To close the cracks. We put the vertices of the cracks in a List and apply divide and conquer strategy to tesselate them. Minimum number of edges is 6 in a given edgelist. 
          
For each edge E[Xk, Xk+1] in Le we find a vertex Xs in Le so that the triangle T(Xk, Xk+1, Xs) split the contour and have a correct orientation. Xs should be in front of E and Not be any of Xk-1 or Xk+2.

abstract = {Many visual cues for surface reconstruction from known views are sparse in nature, e.g., specularities, surface silhouettes, and salient features in an otherwise textureless region. Often, these cues are the only information available to an observer. To allow these constraints to be used either in conjunction with dense constraints such as pixel-wise similarity, or alone, we formulate such constraints in a variational framework. We propose a sparse variational constraint in the level set framework, enforcing a surface to pass through a specific point, and a sparse variational constraint on the surface normal along the observed viewing direction, as is the nature of, e.g., specularities. These constraints are capable of reconstructing surfaces from extremely sparse data. The approach has been applied and validated on the shape from specularities problem.},

2. Particles move along the gradient vector field of the source implicit object until they intersect with the destination support object.

4. The particle dies at support object and the resulting texture coordinates are fixed for the associated starting vertex.
        
5. The gradient vector field for the support object is used to attract particles towards the  object. Using a linear parametric equations the amount of applied forces are balanced between source and support surfaces.
        
Problems: 
        
1. NO suitable control exists between the texture and the implicit model. Modifications for the texture image are necessary.
        
2. It should be very slow to apply this method on large models. Or models with high number of vertices.},

To make a deformation on the model each participant should request for an update right which is acknowledged by the session server. Each client sends up to date parameters to other participants in the same session server to notify them of the latest changes, that client will then release the update right and saves tree data in the session server. The rendering time is tracked to maintain a consistent update frequency on each client machine i.e. slower systems perform lower quality mesh extraction for rendering. },

The program allows trainee surgeons to practice the technique with varying degrees of visual feedback-and no risk to the patient. It allows them to learn both the technique and the associated anatomy. The trainees can be assessed while performing the procedure. This is a small, early-stage application of virtual reality in surgical education. There is a demand for surgical training techniques that expose the patient to no risk; the use of computers is appropriate to meet this demand. The technique presented here requires further development; in particular, it needs a standardized assessment element that will allow it to be tested by established surgeons and trainees. The real test of a good training technique is how well it discriminates between trainee and trainer.},

The need for accurate surgical simulation has spurred the development of many of the new real-time FE methodologies that enable haptic support and real-time deformation. These techniques are computationally intensive and it has proved to be a challenge to achieve the high modeling resolutions required to accurately represent complex anatomies. The authors present a new real-time methodology based on linear FE analysis that is appropriate for a wide range of surgical simulation applications. A methodology is proposed that is characterized by high model resolution, low preprocessing time, unrestricted multipoint surface contact, and adjustable boundary conditions. These features make the method ideal for modeling suturing, which is an element common to almost every surgical procedure. This paper describes constraints in the context of a Suturing Simulator currently being developed by the authors.},

One of its fields of application lies in virtual reality, mainly in surgery simulation systems. In computer graphics, the models used for the construction of objects with deformable behaviour are known as deformable models. These have two conflicting characteristics: interactivity and motion realism. The different deformable models developed to date have promoted only one of these (usually interactivity) to the detriment of the other (biomechanical realism). In this paper, we present a classification of the different deformable models that have been developed. We present the advantages and disadvantages of each one. Finally, we make a comparison of deformable models and perform an evaluation of the state of the art and the future of deformable models.},

Virtual Objects are divided to Rigid and Deformable types. Rigid objects are easier to model because deformable objects can have Self-Collision, Deformation, 
Large and Varying areas of contact. 
        
Haptic rendering is a bi-directional flow of information starting from Human operator, Haptic device, Haptic Rendering to Simulation Engine. 
        
The position of haptic device tool are sent to collision detection module where it is checked to find any Virtual-Object and Avatar collision in the virtual evironment the contact surface and position of collision are sent to Force response module to compute the reaction forces and are subsequently sent to control algorithms to be transduced to Haptic device. 
        
Force rendering algorithms are categorized based on the number of Degrees of Freedom to 4 groups:
1. One-DOF interaction 2. Two DOF 3. Three Dof 4. More than Three DOF
        
Virtual Wall is used as a benchmark in studying haptic stability.

abstract = {Realistic finite element modelling and simulation of neurosurgical procedures present a formidable challenge. Appropriate, finite deformation, constitutive model of brain tissue is a prerequisite for such development. In this paper, a large deformation, linear, viscoelastic model, suitable for direct use with commercially available finite element software packages such as ABAQUS is constructed. The proposed constitutive equation is of polynomial form with time-dependent coefficients. The model requires four material constants to be identified. The material constants were evaluated based on unconfined compression experiment results. The analytical as well as numerical solutions to the unconfined compression problem are presented. The agreement between the proposed theoretical model and the experiment is good for compression levels reaching 30\% and for loading velocities varying over five orders of magnitude. The numerical solution using the finite element method matched the analytical solution very closely.},

abstract = {Experienced algorithm designers rely heavily on a set of building blocks and on the tools needed to put the blocks together into an algorithm. The understanding of these basic blocks and tools is therefore critical to the understanding of algorithms. Many of the blocks and tools needed for parallel algorithms extend from sequential algorithms, such as dynamic-programming and divide-and-conquer, but others are new. This paper introduces one of the simplest and most useful building blocks for parallel algorithms: the all-prefix-sums operation. The paper defines the operation, shows how to implement it on a PRAM and illustrates many applications of the operation. In addition to being a useful building block, the all-prefix-sums operation is a good example of a computation that seems inherently sequential, but for which there is an efficient parallel algorithm.},

In this model, we investigate the coupling of biological parameters with a 3-D model, to improve the behavior of the brain in surgical simulators. The model was assessed by comparing the simulated ventricular enlargement with a patient case study of communicating hydrocephalus. In our model, cerebro-spinal fluid production-resorption system is coupled with a 3-D representation of the brain parenchyma. We introduce a new bi-phasic model of the brain (brain tissue and extracellular fluid) allowing for fluid exchange between the brain extracellular space and the venous system. The time evolution of ventricular pressure has been recorded on a symptomatic patient after closing the ventricular shunt. A finite element model has been built based on a computed tomography scan of this patient, and quantitative comparisons between experimental measures and simulated data are proposed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new approach to simulate the small intestine in a context of laparoscopic surgery. The ultimate aim of this work is to simulate the training of a basic surgical gesture in real-time: moving aside the intestine to reach hidden areas of the abdomen. The main problem posed by this kind of simulation is animating the intestine. The problem comes from the nature of the intestine: a very long tube which is not isotropically elastic, and is contained in a volume that is small when compared to the intestine's length. It coils extensively and collides with itself in many places. To do this, we use a layered model to animate the intestine. The intestine's axis is animated as a linear mechanical component. A specific sphere-based model handles contacts and self-collisions. A skinning model is used to create the intestine's volume around the axis. This paper discusses and compares three different representations for skinning the intestine: a parametric surface model and two implicit surface models. The first implicit surface model uses point skeletons while the second uses local convolution surfaces. Using these models, we obtained good-looking results in real-time.

abstract = {Efficient and accurate techniques for simulation of soft tissue deformation are an increasingly valuable tool in many areas of medical image computing, such as biomechanically-driven image registration and interactive surgical simulation. For reasons of efficiency most analyses are based on simplified linear formulations, and previously almost all have ignored well established features of tissue mechanical response such as anisotropy and time-dependence. We address these latter issues by firstly presenting a generalised anisotropic viscoelastic constitutive framework for soft tissues, particular cases of which have previously been used to model a wide range of tissues. We then develop an efficient solution procedure for the accompanying viscoelastic hereditary integrals which allows use of such models in explicit dynamic finite element algorithms. We show that the procedure allows incorporation of both anisotropy and viscoelasticity for as little as 5.1\% additional cost compared with the usual isotropic elastic models. Finally we describe the implementation of a new GPU-based finite element scheme for soft tissue simulation using the CUDA API. Even with the inclusion of more elaborate constitutive models as described the new implementation affords speed improvements compared with our recent graphics API-based implementation, and compared with CPU execution a speed up of 56.3 x is achieved. The validity of the viscoelastic solution procedure and performance of the GPU implementation are demonstrated with a series of numerical examples.},

In this paper we propose to use the Total Lagrangian formulation of the Finite Element method together with Dynamic Relaxation for computing intra-operative organ deformations. We study the best ways of estimating the parameters involved and we propose a termination criteria that can be used in order to obtain fast results with prescribed accuracy. The simulation results prove the accuracy and computational efficiency of the method, even in cases involving large deformations, nonlinear materials and contacts.},

@article{Sim2006,
abstract = {Contemporary medical robotic systems used in urologic surgery usually consist of a computer and a mechanical device to carry out the designated task with an image acquisition module. These systems are typically from one of the two categories: offline or online robots. Offline robots, also known as fixed path robots, are completely automated with pre-programmed motion planning based on pre-operative imaging studies where precise movements within set confines are carried out. Online robotic systems rely on continuous input from the surgeons and change their movements and actions according to the input in real time. This class of robots is further divided into endoscopic manipulators and master-slave robotic systems. Current robotic surgical systems have resulted in a paradigm shift in the minimally invasive approach to complex laparoscopic urological procedures. Future developments will focus on refining haptic feedback, system miniaturization and improved augmented reality and telesurgical capabilities.},

2.Primitive Shape
        
The main contribution is using a decay function extracted from Ellipsoid equation. (x\^{}2/a\^{}2 + y\^{}2/b\^{}2 + z\^{}2/c\^{}2 = 1)
We need to calculate the distance from a point p to the center of primitive this is r = OP then along the line given by OP we march we get the point Q where the Field value is 0.
We name this one Q and OQ is called Radius Of Influence (ROI). Beyond ROI field function would be zero. The length of OQ = R. if r >= R then field is zero.
        
Decay function is 1-r\^{}2/R\^{}2

annote = {presents a method for parallelizing the Catmull-Clark subdivision and removing T-junctions depending
on the view frustum. The T-junctions appear in the mesh as a result of adjacent faces of the mesh getting
subdivided by separate execution units on the GPU. The method can be described in five steps assuming
basic knowledge about the Catmull-Clark algorithm.
First they initiate a criterion of what faces to be subdivided depending on the view frustum describing
what objects and polygons of the scene being visible. If it is satisfied by all faces the mesh is displayed and if
not face points are generated for each face to be subdivided and mesh structure updated. Then edge points
are generated for relevant edges and mesh structure updated again. Finally all vertices in need of updates
are evaluated and moved to new positions.
When the criterion is met for all faces they apply their method for fixing T-junctions solving the problem
with cracks that may appear in the mesh. A T-junction is created from a vertex that belongs to an edge
without being its starting or end vertex.
What enables the use of this method is the chosen data structure that enables parallel updates of the
mesh structure at high performance. In the data structure they store the base mesh, temporary data as well
as two copies of the subdivided mesh (In, Out). More can be read about it in [2].},

annote = {The parameters involved in qualifying implicit surfaces are mainly:
        
1.Speed
2.Accuracy
        
Detailed: 
1. Good meshes will contain mostly equilateral triangles. (without distorted thin triangles that can be seen in poorer approaches)
2. Topologically consistent meaning not to have holes or disconnected elements. 
3. They should Approximate the surface faithfully. 
3. Be efficient with a minimum number if triangles.
        
Mesh Quality: 
1. Reduced number of triangles
2. Homogeneous triangle sizes
3. Minimizing distance to the surface
4. Curvature
5. Normal direction errors
        
In this paper the authors used Maximum Absolute Curvature or (MAC) to produce a triangulated version of an implicit surface. They used variational implicit surfaces or (VIS) and their datasets used Turk method 
for creating an implicit function from a set of points on the surface. They assumed that the implicit function provides them with Value, Gradient, Normal and Hessian Matrix at a given 3D point.
        
They Hessian to calculate MAC and eigen values of the hessian. This will give them heuristic edge length for the triangles that build the mesh at point X.
Using the edge length they expand a point on surface to a hexagon and calculate all the angles of the new points (External Angles). Then we find the point on hexagon with the minimum external angle. Which is our next candidate.
We call this hexagon "FRONT". The candidate point will be expanded but it will be checked for collisions with other existing ones first.
        
        
If we have self intersection we will split the current candidate angle. If we have collision with others we will merge with them. Otherwise we expand at the newly generated point.
        
The algorithm is faster than shrinkwrap and MT. The resulting mesh has quasi-equi lateral triangles.},

abstract = {This contribution presents finite element computation of the deformation field within the brain during craniotomy-induced brain shift. The results were used to illustrate the capabilities of non-linear (i.e. accounting for both geometric and material non-linearities) finite element analysis in non-rigid registration of pre- and intra-operative magnetic resonance images of the brain. We used patient-specific hexahedron-dominant finite element mesh, together with realistic material properties for the brain tissue and appropriate contact conditions at boundaries. The model was loaded by the enforced motion of nodes (i.e. through prescribed motion of a boundary) at the brain surface in the craniotomy area. We suggest using explicit time-integration scheme for discretised equations of motion, as the computational times are much shorter and accuracy, for practical purposes, the same as in the case of implicit integration schemes. Application of the computed deformation field to register (i.e. align) the pre-operative images with the intra-operative ones indicated that the model very accurately predicts the displacements of the tumour and the lateral ventricles even for limited information about the brain surface deformation. The prediction accuracy improves when information about deformation of not only exposed (during craniotomy) but also unexposed parts of the brain surface is used when prescribing loading. However, it appears that the accuracy achieved using information only about the deformation of the exposed surface, that can be determined without intra-operative imaging, is acceptable. The presented results show that non-linear biomechanical models can complement medical image processing techniques when conducting non-rigid registration. Important advantage of such models over the previously used linear ones is that they do not require unrealistic assumptions that brain deformations are infinitesimally small and brain stress-strain relationship is linear.},

It is shown that the Young's modulus of the brain parenchyma used in previous studies (3000-10000 Pa) corresponds to strain rates much higher than those present in hydrocephalic brains. Consideration of the brain's viscoelasticity leads to the derivation of a considerably lower modulus value of approximately 584 Pa.},

By computing the shortest distance of the center of each cell to implicit surface and comparing it to half of the diagonal [0.866a] one can reject all those cells that are outside the ring zone.

In this paper we present an implementation of our algorithms on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) using the new NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which leads to more than 20 times increase in the computation speed. This makes possible the use of meshes with more elements, which better represent the geometry, are easier to generate, and provide more accurate results.},

abstract = {This study investigates the mechanics of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) growth using a computational approach. We created a generic 3-D brain mesh of a healthy human brain and modelled the brain parenchyma as single phase and biphasic continuum. In our model, hyperelastic constitutive law and finite deformation theory described deformations within the brain parenchyma. We used a value of 155.77Pa for the shear modulus (mu) of the brain parenchyma. Additionally, in our model, contact boundary definitions constrained the brain outer surface inside the skull. We used transmantle pressure difference to load the model. Fully nonlinear, implicit finite element procedures in the time domain were used to obtain the deformations of the ventricles and the brain. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first 3-D, fully nonlinear model investigating NPH growth mechanics. Clinicians generally accept that at most 1mm of Hg transmantle pressure difference (133.416Pa) is associated with the condition of NPH. Our computations showed that transmantle pressure difference of 1mm of Hg (133.416Pa) did not produce NPH for either single phase or biphasic model of the brain parenchyma. A minimum transmantle pressure difference of 1.764mm of Hg (235.44Pa) was required to produce the clinical condition of NPH. This suggested that the hypothesis of a purely mechanical basis for NPH growth needs to be revised. We also showed that under equal transmantle pressure difference load, there were no significant differences between the computed ventricular volumes for biphasic and incompressible/nearly incompressible single phase model of the brain parenchyma. As a result, there was no major advantage gained by using a biphasic model for the brain parenchyma. We propose that for modelling NPH, nearly incompressible single phase model of the brain parenchyma was adequate. Single phase treatment of the brain parenchyma simplified the mathematical description of the NPH model and resulted in significant reduction of computational time.},

abstract = {Realistic computer simulation of neurosurgical procedures requires incorporation of the mechanical properties of brain tissue in the mathematical model. Possible applications of computer simulation of neurosurgery include non-rigid registration, virtual reality training and operation planning systems and robotic devices to perform minimally invasive brain surgery. A number of constitutive models of brain tissue, both single-phase and bi-phasic, have been proposed in recent years. The major deficiency of most of them, however, is the fact that they were identified using experimental data obtained in vitro and there is no certainty whether they can be applied in the realistic in vivo setting. In this paper we attempt to show that previously proposed by us hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model of brain tissue can be applied to simulating surgical procedures. An in vivo indentation experiment is described. The force-displacement curve for the loading speed typical for surgical procedures is concave upward containing no linear portion from which a meaningful elastic modulus might be determined. In order to properly analyse experimental data, a three-dimensional, non-linear finite element model of the brain was developed. Magnetic resonance imaging techniques were used to obtain geometric information needed for the model. The shape of the force-displacement curve obtained using the numerical solution was very similar to the experimental one. The predicted forces were about 31\% lower than those recorded during the experiment. Having in mind that the coefficients in the model had been identified based on experimental data obtained in vitro, and large variability of mechanical properties of biological tissues, such agreement can be considered as very good. By appropriately increasing material parameters describing instantaneous stiffness of the tissue one is able, without changing the structure of the model, to reproduce experimental curve almost perfectly. Numerical studies showed also that the linear, viscoelastic model of brain tissue is not appropriate for the modelling brain tissue deformation even for moderate strains.},

While the graphical performance of commercial systems already makes PC-based simulators viable, the real-time simulation of soft tissue deformation is still the major obstacle in developing simulators for soft-tissue surgery. The goal of the present work is to develop a framework for the full-scale, real-time, finite element simulation of elastic tissue deformation in complex systems such as the human abdomen. The key for such a development is the proper formulation of the model, the development of scalable parallel solution algorithms, and special-purpose parallel hardware. The developed techniques will be used for the implementation of a gynecological laparoscopic VR-trainer system.},
