\startchapter{Deformable Model}
\label{chapter:deformablemodel}
Interactive visualization techniques developed in the previous chapters support a \blob based modelling 
system for the incremental construction process. In a surgical simulation scenario, tissues undergo 
various levels of deformations and topological modifications. Researchers in the field studied different 
approaches to recreate the elastic behavior of tissues. The two main challenges that are reported 
continuously in this field are interactivity and fidelity of motion \cite{Meier2005}. 

Based on the foundation built so far, we build a deformable model to support 
the required interactions with surgical tools i.e., elastic deformations by pushing the tissue. 
The next chapter will address the problem associated with cutting, which is a primary operation in 
many surgical simulation scenarios. The goal is to make a comprehensive system that bridges the gap 
between modelling and simulation of tissues. 

\section{Overview}
A software pipeline is developed to support physically based simulation of deformable tissues using our 
implicit modelling framework, figure \ref{fig:systempipeline}.

Stages 1 and 2 in the pipeline are associated with the modelling process which is 
already discussed in section \ref{sec:implicitmodellingintro}. Stage 3 is 
associated with the polygonization algorithms that are developed in chapters \ref{chapter:cpuPoly} 
and \ref{chapter:GPUDiscretization}. Also in stage 3 is the volume discretization technique that converts 
the \blob model into a tetrahedral mesh for physical simulation. This stage is discussed further in 
section \ref{sec:physicalmodel}. The material that is discussed in the current and the next chapters are associated with the 
stage 4 of the pipeline shown above. The output of the system is the simulation environment that 
facilitates deformations and cutting which is shown as the final stage of the pipeline.
