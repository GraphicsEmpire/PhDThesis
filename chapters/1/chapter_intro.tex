\section{General aim of this Research}
The goal of this thesis is to develop a framework for physically based animation of soft tissues which are increasingly used in
games, movies and simulation systems. Although at this stage this physically-based model is a goal in itself, it is hoped that
it will eventually be used for clinical predictions and for research on the influence of deformations on the functional properties 
of deformable tissues. In order to demonstrate this potential, preliminary studies in that direction are reported in the final chapter
of this thesis. To that end, a brain biopsy simulation scenerio is created where the operator can interact with the brain tissue and 
cut small samples of a tumor. 

In this research we tackled three main problems found in the domain of soft tissue simulation and has been the topic of interest for many
researchers in the field. First, our proposed modeling solution captures the key advantages found in volumetric modeling approaches using 
implicit surfaces \cite{Bloomenthal1997, Wyvill1986, Wyvill1999, Wyvill1996, Wyvill1997, Schmidt2006, Bernhardt2010a}. Automatic blending and compact 
representation are the major benefits of using implicit surfaces for modeling. In addition, the ability to perform inside-outside tests 
easily is an inherent advantage in implicit models when implementing physically based simulations requiring collision tests. 
The \blob \cite{Wyvill1999} combined blending, affine transformations and constructive solid geometry (CSG) operators in a 
comprehensive and compact scene graph data-structure. \blob provides the ability to create complex models incrementally \cite{Schmidt2006}. 
However, volumetric models in general are often several orders of magnitude slower during visualization \cite{Bloomenthal1990a, Bloomenthal1997}.
We proposed a data-driven algorithm for rendering complex implicit models in realtime on multi-core processors \cite{Shirazian2012}, later, we 
fine tuned that algorithm for running on many core architectures such as the ones in high-end graphical processing units (GPUs). 

In traditional animation systems based on key-framing, specifying the motion and the successive shapes of objects interacting with a simulated 
world requires a great amount of specialized knowledge and intuition from the animator. Models based on simplified physical laws have been 
proposed for automating these tasks. They generate motion and deformation from initial conditions and from a set of externally applied forces 
over time, and automatically detect and respond to collisions. These models are particularly appropriate for facilitating the animation of 
deformable objects. They can either be used alone for the simulation of inanimate bodies, or be combined with user-controlled structures as 
has been done for instance in character animation \cite{chadwick1989layered,miller1988motion}. We show that a number of problems that are difficult
to solve with previous models can be easily handled by combining them with an external layer based on implicit surfaces. The implicit formulation
defines a smooth surface around the object that can be used to perform efficient collision detection, to enable exact contact modeling, and to ease
volume preservation. The second contribution of our research is the high performance volume discretization technique and non-linear finite element 
formulation to support the elastic deformations of the created models \cite{Shirazian2013}. 

In modern interactive simulation and modeling enviroments the ability to cut 3-dimensional geometry in realtime is of fundamental importance. 
This creates the need for efficient cutting algorithms that process the underlying representation. Such methods can be utilized in a wide spectrum 
of applications including surgical interventions, free form modeling, or scientific visualization. In surgery simulation, for instance, interactive 
cutting algorithms enable the dynamic simulation of scalpel intersections that open immediately behind the scalpel \cite{Nienhuys2001}. In the 
case of free-form modeling or sculpting, dynamic cutting supports a precise positioning and guidance of a cutting tool. In scientific visualization, 
real-time cutting algorithms create new opportunities for the interactive analysis of volume data sets. Seismic data sets, as an example, can be 
cut arbitrarily along interesting strata. The third main contribution of our research is our GPU-assisted interactive cutting algorithm that allows
arbitrary cuts in the model and can enable many scenarios for tissue manipulation and sensing. 

In what follows, the implicit modeling approach to deformable tissue modeling will be studied. To achieve the initial goal of this research, a
computational framework for designing, rendering and animating deformable tissues has been developed which has the potential to be used in any 
simulation system requiring deformable tissues with some level of interaction and topolgy modification. The final chapter of this thesis is dedicated
for the evaluation of our system and analysis of some example scenarios in which our system might be a good fit for. 

\section{Implicit Modeling}
Implicit surfaces are two-dimensional, geometric shapes that exist in three-dimentional space; they can be defined based on discrete data, 
radial basis functions, offset surfaces, algebraic surfaces, level sets or distance fields to skeletal geometric primitives \cite{Bloomenthal1997}.
Independently of its origin, an implicit surface can be defined as a level-set function $F:\mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where the surface 
can be defined for instance as the set of points $\left\{M(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 | F(x,y,x) = c\right\}$. $c$ is a constant and is called 
the \textit{iso-value} which is set to $0.5$ in our system. For each point in space if the field is greater than
$c$ the point is considered inside the model otherwise outside. 

Most of the primitives used in the \blob are built from geometric skeletons, which are incorporated in many implicit modeling software packages 
such as BlobTree.net \cite{de2008blobtree} or ShapeShop \cite{Schmidt2006}. They are ideally suited to prototype shapes of arbitrary topology 
\cite{Bloomenthal1997}. In general these works conclude that the use of skeletal primitives can lead to a simple and intuitive user modelling 
methodology. The basic building block of a skeletal primitive is a skeleton $S$. To create a skeletal primitive the distance-field $dS$ of the 
volume encapsulating the shape has to be computed as described in \cite{Barbier2004}. The distance field is a volume of scalar values which is 
not bounded as the distance itself can be infinitely large.

By modifying $dS$ with a field function $g$, it can be bound to a finite range. Usually the function maps the distances to the range $[0, 1]$, 
where the field has values of 1 at the skeletons and 0 after a certain distance to the skeleton (usually at distance 1). A discussion of field 
function appears in \cite{shirley2009graphics}. Skeletal implicit primitives are combined using binary operators, which are applied pair wise to 
field-values f, and represented by a node in the BlobTree, whose children are either primitives or operators themselves.
Field values are computed for the child-nodes and combined to yield a new value according to the operator type. This makes it possible to go beyond 
the classical Boolean operators, and define general blend operators that e.g. create smooth transitions between shapes. The most common operator 
that creates a smooth transition between several values is called the summation blend \cite{Bloomenthal1997}:

\begin{equation}
F_A(x, y, z)=\sum_{i=1}^{i=N_A}F_i(x, y, z)
\end{equation}

Where an implicit model $A$ is generated by summing the influences of $N_A$ skeletal elements: 
The field value due to an skeletal element at a point in 3D space is computed as filtered distance to its skeleton 
where the filter function (i.e. falloff function) is defined as follows \cite{Wyvill1999}: 

\begin{equation}
g_\mathrm{wyvill}(x)= \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
 1 &\mbox{ if $x\leq0$} \\
 (1-x^2)^3 &\mbox{ if $0<x<1$}\\
  0 &\mbox{ if $x\geq1$}  
  \end{array} \right.
\label{eq:WyvillFunc}
\end{equation}

In equation \ref{eq:WyvillFunc}, $x$ is clamped to the range $[0,1]$. This polynomial smoothly decreases from 1 to 0 over the valid range, with zero
tangents at each end. An important property of this skeletal primitive definition is that the scalar field is \textit{bounded}, meaning that $f=0$
outside some sphere with finite radius. Bounded fields guarantee local influence, preventing changes made to a small part of a complex model from
affecting distant portions of the surface. Local influence preserves a \textquotedblleft principle of least surprise\textquotedblright that is critical for interactive modeling.  
Normals can be derived from gradients which are computed by evaluating 4 field values and performing a numerical approximation:

\begin{equation}
\nabla F(x,y,z)=\left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
 F(x+\delta,y,z)-f \\
 F(x, y +\delta,z)-f \\
 F(x, y, z+\delta)-f \\
  \end{array} \right. 
\label{eq:Normal}
\end{equation}

Where $f = F(x,y,z)$ is the field at point $(x,y,z)$.
% $fv = F(x,y,z)$ be the field at a point:
%$\nabla F(x,y,z)=\frac{1}{\delta}\left( F(x+\delta,y,z)-fv \right)$

Each skeletal primitive has a bounded region of influence in space. For each node in the tree an
axis-aligned bounding box is computed which is used to trivially reject those field queries that 
are outside the box. The bounding box of the entire model is computed as the union of all primitive
nodes bounding boxes.

For evaluating the field  at a point $P$ in a \blob model such as the one shown in figure (\ref{fig:CoffeeMugBlobTree}), 
the tree structure should be traversed from root to leaves recursively. 
Each operator combines the values of its children according to its type.
For example, for a simple blend the values are summed. A leaf node represents
a primitive,  and returns the value by applying equation~\ref{eq:WyvillFunc} to 
  the distance of $P$ from the primitive.

\end{figure}

%As the tree gets deeper and the number of primitives increase the computation 
For visualization purposes the \blob is queried numerous times to evaluate the field. As suggested in \cite{SWG2005} 
accelerating field computation will have a large impact on the overall surface extraction process. 

\section{Sweep Surfaces and Sketching}
Implicit primitives in our system are created from skeletons which are simple geometrical shapes such as points, line segments or 
polygons from which volumetric distance fields are created. In order to support more complex geometries \textit{Schmidt} \etal proposed the
implicit sweep objects technique where the 2D shape sketched by the user is sampled and an implicit approximation is created from 
the sample points \cite{Schmidtc}. This is done by fitting a thin-plate spline as a base shape to the sampled points using variational 
interpolation \cite{Turk1999}. One advantage of creating the base shape using variational interpolation is that the resulting implicit 
field is $C^2$ continuous, a property needed when the shape is involved in several blending operations \cite{barthe2004controllable}.

A continuous 2D scalar field is created from several field value samples $(\mathbf{m}_i, v_i)$, where $\mathbf{m}_i$ describes the 
position of the sample and $v_i$ is the desired field. The thin-plate spline used to create the variational 
implicit field $f_c(\mathbf{u})$ is defined in terms of these points weighted by corresponding coefficients $w_i$ combined with a polynomial 
$P(u) = c_1u_x +c_2u_y +c_3$.

\begin{equation}
f_c(\mathbf{u}) = \sum_{i \in N} w_i(\|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{m}_i\|)^2ln(\|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{m}_i\|)+P(\mathbf{u}) 
\label{eq:thinplatespline}
\end{equation}

The weights $w_i$ and coefficients $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$ are found by solving a linear system defined by evaluating 
equation \ref{eq:thinplatespline} at each known solution $f_c(\mathbf{m}_i)=v_i$.
The resulting thin plate spline can then be used as the basis of several different primitives:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Inflated Objects
 \item Swept object along a trajectory
 \item Revolving object around axis
\end{itemize}

These sketched objects can then be used in the same way as the standard skeletal implicit primitives to create unique 3D shapes. Such 
unique shapes were not possible to create in previous collaborative environments, especially given this technique’s small memory footprint 
needed to transfer the information.
