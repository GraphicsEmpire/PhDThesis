\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}
A surgical simulation system requires models of elastic material to behave 
accurately, to appear as realistic as possible, and allow interaction that can 
deform and change the topology of the model.
 For example pushing on a model  should produce physically accurate deformations without changing the topology. 
 A cutting operation is 
more complex as it requires the  topology to change. Both of these procedures are required 
for surgical scenes in order to bring those models to life sufficiently to be useful for surgical planning or
training.
In this research we propose a comprehensive framework for high-performance rendering
and physically-based animation of deformable  tissues using implicit surfaces.
Our system provides an interactive cutting ability using smooth intersection surfaces.
Complex models can be created with implicit primitives, blending operators, affine
transformations, deformations and constructive solid geometry in a design environment that organizes
all these in a scene graph data structure called the BlobTree. We show that the
BlobTree modelling approach provides a very compact data structure which supports 
the requirements above, as well as 
incremental changes and network-based cooperative design.
Using a finite element approach we discretize BlobTree models with a GPU-Assisted
algorithm for accurate physically-based animation. Interactions with the model are
supported through smooth progressive cut surfaces. We show an application of our
system in a human skull craniotomy simulation.
