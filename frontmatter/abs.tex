\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}
Implicit models inherently support automatic blending and trivial collision detection 
which makes them an effective tool for designing complex organic shapes with many applications in 
various areas of research including surgical simulation systems. However, slow rendering speeds can 
adversely affect the performance of simulation and modelling systems. In addition, when the models are 
incorporated in a surgical simulation system, interactive and smooth cutting becomes a required feature 
for many procedures.

In this research, we propose a comprehensive framework for high-performance rendering
and physically-based animation of tissues modelled using implicit surfaces. Our 
goal is to address performance and scalability issues that arise in rendering 
complex implicit models as well as in dynamic interactions between surgical tool and models. 


Complex models can be created with implicit primitives, blending operators, affine
transformations, deformations and constructive solid geometry in a design environment that organizes
all these in a scene graph data structure called the BlobTree. We show that the
BlobTree modelling approach provides a very compact data structure which supports 
the requirements above, as well as incremental changes and trivial collision detection.
A GPU-assisted surface extraction algorithm is proposed to support interactive modelling of complex 
BlobTree models.

Using a finite element approach we discretize those models for accurate physically-based animation. 
Our system provides an interactive cutting ability using smooth intersection surfaces.
We show an application of our system in a human skull craniotomy simulation.
